# PNG to SVG Converter

This is a smart tool that converts PNG images into scalable vector graphics (SVG). Built using Node.js, Express, and ImageTracerJS, it provides a web interface for designers and developers to easily convert and download resolution-independent SVGs.

---

## ✨ Features

* ✅ Upload multiple PNG files at once (batch processing)
* ✅ Automatic vectorization using ImageTracerJS
* ✅ Browser-based drag-and-drop interface
* ✅ Download converted SVG files instantly
* ✅ Handles image loading with canvas in Node.js

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository or unzip the project

```bash
unzip png-to-svg.zip
cd png-to-svg
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Start the server

```bash
npm start
```

Open your browser at: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## 🖼️ How to Use

1. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`
2. Select one or more PNG images
3. Click **Convert**

## 🧠 How It Works

* Files are uploaded via an HTML form using Multer (middleware for handling multipart/form-data).
* Each image is loaded into a canvas using the `canvas` library.
* `ImageTracerJS` traces the image and converts it into SVG format.
* The SVG is saved and made available for download.
